      <p>This month I was in the process of adopting a dog and I decided to build a data-set of dogs available for adoption.</p>
      
      <p>I found a website <a href="http://www.24petsconnect.com">www.24petsconnect.com</a> that appears to work with many animal shelters across the country to advertise their pets.</p>
      
      <p>After exploring their website, I created a browser automation to enter a zip code and pull the subdirectories of nearby shelters.</p>
      
      <p>In part to confine my search, I fed this a list of zip codes in New Mexico, my home state. (I had a list of 379 zip codes there, but other websites indicate there are 427, so I may have missed a few). After dropping duplicated shelters that registered as proximate to multiple zip codes, this yielded 76 shelters.</p>
      
      <p>At the subdirectory for each shelter, up to 30 pets are listed per page, with each pet’s ad connected to a detailed page with more information about the pet.</p>
      
      <p>I built functions to scrape each page, visiting each pet’s “detail” page to scrape information there too, moving through each page pertaining to the shelter until they were exhausted.</p>
      
      <p>Then I wrote some code to clean the scraped data and produce some descriptive statistics about the group as a whole.</p>
      
      <p><b>Findings:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>At present, there are 4,478 dogs available for adoption in New Mexico listed via 24petsconnect.com.</li>
        <li>The male/female ratio is roughly even (0.95:1).</li>
        <li>Of dogs with known and stated breed, German Shepherd Dog mix and German Shepherd Dog are the most common, followed by American Pit Bull Terrier Mix.</li>
        <li>The most popular names assigned by shelters are Luna (18 dogs), Rocky (16 dogs), and Buddy (13 dogs).</li>
        <li>The most common age-range for dogs is 3-6 months.</li>
        <li>Most dogs have been in the shelter less than 50 days. There are some extreme outliers (in shelter more than 3 years) but that may be due to lack of updating by the shelter.</li>
      </ul>
